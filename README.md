# Predicting Heart Failure Mortality Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project explores the **Heart Failure Clinical Records** dataset to predict patient survival rates using machine learning techniques. The focus is on evaluating classification models and optimizing performance through preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.

## Methods  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Outlier removal, class balancing (SMOTE), feature scaling (StandardScaler)  
- **Models Tested**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)  
- **Model Selection**: KNN and LDA showed the best performance and were further tuned for accuracy and recall.

## Results  
- Evaluated various classifiers and selected the best-performing model for predicting patient outcomes.
